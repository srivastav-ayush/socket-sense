# Socket Sense
### Remote Internship at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden
Worked with the Socket Sense research group at KTH under the guidance of Prof. Dejiu Chen. I was a part of a team that was using Finite Element Analysis & Biomechanical Modelling to investigate the pressure distribution on a transfemoral amputee's stump in contact with the prosthetic socket.<br><br>
